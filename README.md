Ejercicio 1 del modulo 1 del CEDV
.


Exercise statement:
The exercise will consist of an extension of the project managed in the Blueprints sessions.

The minimum requirements for the fiscal year to be resolved are set out below:

Creation of a new level, whose load or transition will be made from another level through a new portal similar to the other levels.
Integration of a HUD with relevant information associated to the level.
Add new action to the main character to interact with the environment using the E key (e. g. activate a button on the wall).
Dynamic deployment of enemies from time to time. The enemy's behavior will be that of moving towards the player, firing projectiles at the main character. It is not necessary to implement AI for enemies; simple translations can be used.
Add life to the main character, which will be affected when an enemy projectile hits the player or there is a collision between enemy and main character, using HUD.
The level will have a series of mechanisms, of the same type (e. g. button on wall), so that the activation of one of them will release a key, while the rest will generate enemies. When the player holds the key (it is not necessary to recreate animations), the only existing portal will be reactivated so that the player can leave the level.
Some considerations:

The exercise is intended to be solved with Blueprints, but it is possible to use C++ as a complement.
With respect to the graphic part, the use of any resource whose license allows it is considered. It is not necessary to faithfully represent the summarized object (e. g. key).
In this regard, and with respect to multimedia resources, it is possible to use those available in the other case studies of the course or anyone with a license to use them. On the following pages there are many of them:

The result of the solution of the exercise must be a. zip file with the content of the project (File->Zip Up Project) and whose name follows the following agreement: CEDV_M1_E01_last name1_name. zip (e. g. CEDV_M1_E01_Vallejo_David. zip). It is important that the packaged project can be opened in the EU4 facility itself.

Due to the maximum size limitations of the tasks in Moodle, this. zip file must be uploaded to a platform such as WeTransfer or Dropbox and the resulting URL will be the one attached to the CampusVirtual task.
